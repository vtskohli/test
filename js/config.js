You can start the letter by describing the rain in your city, and what you think about it.<br>Use the given sample letter.<br>Dear Rita As I am writing this letter to you, I am watching the heavy rain falling outside my bedroom window. It’s my first experience of the Mumbai monsoon, and it is quite extraordinary. We have not seen the sun for two days, and the sky is dark with thick rain clouds. Sometimes, there is a clap of thunder, followed by a bright flash of lightning, and I must tell you honestly that this makes me afraid. So, I am not venturing out of the house till this spell of rain stops. I have taken out my drawing book, and I have made some sketches of the rainy day scenes on the street outside that I can see from my window. The wind has bent some of the trees, and torn off their leaves. After lunch, a neighbour, and a new friend that I have made in Mumbai, is coming over to watch a film. She is bringing come cake and cookies that she has baked to share with me. Even though it is wet and gloomy outside, I think that we are going to have an enjoyable day.

He captained the Indian cricket team and made his test debut as a young, curly haired boy of sixteen in 1989. He is the only player to have scored 100 international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One-day International cricket match, and is the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and one day International matches. Tendulkar is the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket and is affectionately referred to as the ‘master blaster’ and the ‘god of cricket’. Tendulkar, who has won numerous awards from the Indian government including the Arjuna award, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan, was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award,  in 2013. He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive this award. I admire Tendulkar for his awesome talent, his down-to-earth ways and his philanthropy through which he helps many people."],

The excerpt below (also from the book ‘Robinson Crusoe’) is a sample.<br>Use the given paragraph.<br>I began to look around me, to see what kind of place I was in. ‘Where shall I go’? I asked myself. ‘What shall I do’? My clothes were still wet. I could dry them only by sitting in the sun. I had nothing to eat or drink. I had nothing about me but a knife, a pipe and a little tobacco. How could I live on this strange shore without shelter and without food? The thought of this made me almost wild. I ran this way and that, like a madman. Then I sat down and cried like a child. I never felt so lonely as at that moment. I never felt so helpless and lost."],
